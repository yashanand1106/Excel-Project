1.	INTRODUTION

In today’s fast-paced retail environment, the ability to harness data for business insights has become a cornerstone of strategic decision-making. The growing importance of data-driven approaches is evident across industries, especially in retail, where customer preferences, product trends, and market dynamics shift rapidly. The Sujeet Store Data Analysis project serves as a practical case study in applying data analytics to understand and improve retail operations.
This report delves into the transactional and sales data of Sujeet Store—a retail outlet that caters to a wide demographic through both online and offline channels. The store handles a variety of products and receives orders from customers across multiple states. The data used in this analysis captures real-world transactions and interactions recorded during the year 2022. It includes information such as order dates, product categories, sales revenue, order statuses, customer gender and age, delivery channels, and geographical distribution of orders.
The primary objective of this report is to explore this dataset comprehensively using modern data analysis techniques and tools. By performing a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), this report aims to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and insights that may not be immediately visible. For instance, we investigate questions such as: Which states drive the highest sales? Do men and women prefer different product categories? What time of the year sees the highest number of orders? Which sales channels perform better in terms of volume and revenue? What is the correlation between customer age and purchase behavior?
This report is structured methodically to ensure clarity and continuity. It begins with a discussion on the source and structure of the dataset, followed by preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data for analysis. The analysis section is broken down into subsections for general observations, specific formulas or requirements used, key results, and visual interpretations. Throughout the report, charts and graphs will be embedded to provide visual clarity and support for the observations made.
Beyond just performing the analysis, the report also highlights potential future work, suggesting how deeper machine learning or predictive models could further enhance understanding. A professional summary for platforms like LinkedIn is also included, allowing for the sharing of insights with a broader community.
Ultimately, this report showcases how data, when thoughtfully analyzed, can provide valuable insights to support business strategy, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance operational efficiency.

 

2.	SOURCE OF DATASET

The success of any data analysis project relies heavily on the authenticity, relevance, and quality of the dataset being used. In the context of the Sujeet Store Data Analysis project, the dataset serves as the backbone of all analytical operations. This dataset comprises real-world transaction data collected from Sujeet Store during the year 2022. The data was systematically exported from the store’s internal sales and inventory management systems, offering a structured, accurate reflection of the store’s performance over the course of a year.
The dataset represents multiple dimensions of the store’s operational and commercial activity. It includes detailed information on individual sales transactions, products sold, revenue generated, customer demographics, delivery preferences, and regional distributions. Each entry within the dataset corresponds to an individual order or sale and includes the following core attributes:
•	Order ID: A unique identifier that helps in distinguishing each transaction.
•	Product Information: Including the name of the product, the category it belongs to (e.g., men’s wear, women’s wear, accessories), and the quantity ordered.
•	Order Value: The total amount generated from a single transaction.
•	Order Date: Captures the timestamp of the transaction, which is later used to identify time-based trends like monthly peaks or holiday sales spikes.
•	Customer Details: Such as gender and age, allowing us to examine customer segmentation and purchasing behaviour across demographic lines.
•	Delivery Channel: Specifies whether the purchase was made online or in-store, providing insights into the effectiveness of different sales channels.
•	Geographical Location: Indicates the state from which the order originated, useful for analyzing regional performance and market penetration.
•	Order Status: Highlights the completion stage of each order—whether it was successfully delivered, pending, or canceled.
The Excel workbook provided contains multiple sheets, each serving a different analytical purpose. The “Original Data Set” sheet is the raw dump of all recorded transactions. The “Filtered Data Set” represents a refined version of the data after necessary cleaning operations like handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistent entries. Other sheets like “Sales vs Order”, “Top States”, “Men vs Women”, and “Age vs Gender” are already processed datasets that help visualize specific aspects of the overall data.
This layered structure of the dataset ensures that the analysis is based on a foundation of clean, reliable, and diverse information. Moreover, it enables the project to perform multiple types of analysis—ranging from descriptive statistics and demographic segmentation to time-series trend identification and visual storytelling.
The dataset is also versatile and scalable, meaning that it can be extended in future to include additional dimensions such as customer feedback, delivery times, or promotion effects. Such enhancements would further enrich the analytical scope.
To sum up, the dataset used in this report is a comprehensive and well-documented collection of transactional records, offering robust insights into the business operations of Sujeet Store. It not only supports the objectives of this project but also holds potential for deeper analysis and future research initiatives.

3.	Dataset Preprocessing
Before any meaningful analysis can be performed, the raw data must be cleaned, organized, and transformed. This crucial step called Dataset Preprocessing ensures that the dataset is consistent, free from errors, and properly structured for analysis. For the Sujeet Store Data Analysis project, the preprocessing stage involved multiple sub-steps aimed at enhancing data quality and usability.
The original dataset, as found in the “Original Data Set” sheet of the Excel file, contained thousands of transaction records. These records included various columns such as Order ID, Product Name, Category, Quantity, Sales Amount, Order Date, Gender, Age, State, Channel, and Order Status. However, raw datasets often suffer from common data issues such as missing values, duplicate entries, inconsistent formatting, or invalid data points.
Here’s a detailed breakdown of the preprocessing tasks performed:
a)	Handling Missing Values
Some entries were missing key values like customer age or order status. For numerical values (like age or quantity), missing entries were filled using the median or mean, depending on distribution. For categorical fields like state or gender, either the mode was used or rows were removed if the data was non-recoverable.
b)	 Removing Duplicates
Duplicate rows were checked based on Order ID and timestamp combinations. Several duplicate entries were identified—possibly due to repeated logging or export errors—and were removed to avoid skewing results.
c)	Standardizing Formats
Columns such as dates and categorical fields were standardized:
•	Dates were converted to a uniform YYYY-MM-DD format.
•	Gender entries (e.g., “M”, “Male”, “male”) were standardized to “Male”, similarly for “Female”.
•	Channel names were also formatted consistently (e.g., “online”, “Offline”, “Online” → “Online”).
d)	 Type Conversion
Columns were explicitly converted into correct data types:
•	Date to datetime
•	Sales, Age, Quantity to numeric
•	Categorical fields (like gender, order status) were converted to category types for efficient storage and processing.
e)	 Feature Engineering
To facilitate deeper analysis, new columns were derived:
•	Month of Order was extracted from the date for time series grouping.
•	Age Group categories (e.g., 18–25, 26–35) were created for demographic analysis.
•	Order Completion Flag was generated to quantify success rates.
f)	Filtering
Unnecessary records like test transactions or incomplete orders were filtered out. The final “Filtered Data Set” contains only clean, valid, and relevant data for analysis.
This preprocessing step laid the groundwork for precise, insightful analysis. It not only improved data quality but also reduced noise and variability, ensuring that any trends or patterns observed in the later sections are truly reflective of the business realities of Sujeet Store.

g. Automation and AI Integration
As business grows, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and automation can significantly improve operational efficiency:

•	Inventory Automation: Automation in inventory management could help in real-time stock tracking, automatic reorder triggers, and the efficient allocation of resources, leading to reduced wastage and improved customer satisfaction.
•	AI in Marketing: AI algorithms can be used for targeted advertising across social media platforms, helping Sujeet Store reach the most relevant customers based on their online behaviour, demographics, and interests.

h. Technology-Driven Store Experience
In-store customer experience can also benefit from technological enhancements. For example:
•	Virtual Try-Ons: For fashion products, augmented reality (AR) can be integrated to allow customers to virtually try on clothes or accessories.
•	Interactive Displays: In physical stores, interactive kiosks or digital screens can be used to enhance customer experience by displaying product details, reviews, and related items.
